# Data Structures Implementations for Java Extension - Now available on VSCode Marketplace!

Author: Bao To

Welcome to the Java Data Structures Snippets extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides convenient shortcuts to quickly generate code snippets for implementing various data structures in Java.

## Features

With this extension installed, you can use the following commands to create code snippets for different data structures:

- `!linkedlist`: Generates the code snippet for implementing a LinkedList data structure.
- `!hashmap`: Generates the code snippet for implementing a HashMap data structure.
- `!array`: Generates the code snippet for implementing an Array data structure.
- `!arraylist`: Generates the code snippet for implementing an ArrayList data structure.

These snippets will serve as a starting point for your Java projects, saving you time and effort by automatically generating the initial code structure for the selected data structure.

## Requirements

To use this extension, you need to have Visual Studio Code installed on your machine. You also need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed to compile and run the generated code.

## Usage

1. Install the Java Data Structures Snippets extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
2. Open a Java file in Visual Studio Code.
3. To generate a code snippet, simply type one of the predefined commands (`!linkedlist`, `!hashmap`, `!array`, `!arraylist`) followed by a space. For example, typing `!linkedlist ` will trigger the snippet for a LinkedList.
4. Press Tab or Enter to insert the generated code snippet at the current cursor position.

## Example

Let's say you want to implement a LinkedList in your Java project. Instead of manually writing the initial code structure, you can simply type `!linkedlist ` and press Tab or Enter. The extension will generate the necessary code for you to start working on the LinkedList implementation right away.
